# Gatling [![Build Status](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Amain) [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.gatling/gatling-core/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.gatling/gatling-core/)

## What is Gatling ?

Gatling is a load test tool.
It officially supports HTTP, WebSocket, Server-Sent-Events, JMS, gRPC and MQTT.

## Motivation

* Finding fancy GUIs not that convenient for describing load tests, what you want is a friendly expressive DSL in Java, Scala, Kotlin, JavaScript or TypeScript?
* Wanting something more convenient than huge XML dumps to store in your source version control system?
* Fed up with having to host a farm of injecting servers because your tool uses blocking IO and one-thread-per-user architecture?

Gatling is for you!
