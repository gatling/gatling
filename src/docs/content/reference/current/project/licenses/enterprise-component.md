User acknowledges to:

(i)    Comply with the applicable Agreement when using the Component;

### 7. WARRANTIES AND NON-INFRINGEMENT

#### 7.1 Warranties

GATLING CORP warrants that it owns the necessary rights to conclude the Agreement, and notably it owns the intellectual property of the Component (to the exclusion of the rights on third-party software, if any) and the Documentation, for which the right of access and use is granted to User under the License.

The Component is provided “as is” by GATLING CORP. GATLING CORP expressly disclaims any warranty, whether express or implied, non-expressly defined in the Agreement, notably (i) that the functionalities contained in the Component will meet User’s needs and/or that the performance will be uninterrupted or free from bugs or errors and/or to the results obtained from the use and/or the performance of the Component and/or (ii) relating to the damages that may occur to User’s computer equipment, in particular its local infrastructure.

User acknowledges that the scientific and technical state-of-the-art when the Component was distributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of possible defects to be detected. In this respect, User's attention has been drawn to the risks associated with the use of the Component.

The User shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means, the suitability of the Software with its requirements, its good working order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons or properties.

User warrants that it owns the necessary rights for the conclusion and the performance of the Agreement.

#### 7.2 Non-infringement

GATLING CORP warrants User against all third-party claims alleging that the use of the Component by User, in accordance with the Documentation and the provisions of the Agreement, infringes an intellectual property right belonging to said third-party, provided that User informs GATLING CORP without delay of such claim and collaborates actively and in good faith with GATLING CORP in seeking a solution to the dispute.

GATLING CORP shall, at its own discretion and under its own control and management, seek to reach an amicable settlement with such third-party. In the event of the conclusion of an amicable settlement which amount will be agreed upon between GATLING CORP and such third-party, GATLING CORP shall pay the full amount to the third-party. If GATLING CORP fails to reach an amicable settlement, GATLING CORP shall, under its own control and management, ensure the defense of User with the active and good faith collaboration of the User. Under no circumstances, shall User conduct on its own the legal defense of the claim brought by the third-party against itself, and User undertakes to call GATLING CORP into warranty without delay.

In the event of a final court decision having the force of res judicata, GATLING will indemnify User for the amount of the monetary remedies and any interest accrued, provided that User can provide evidence of payment of such sums to the third-party.

The non-infringement warranty stated in this section shall not apply in the following cases:

- the Component is combined with other software, hardware or third-party equipment, where the alleged infringement results from such a combination;
- User continues the infringing activity despite the signing of a settlement or the notification of a final court decision having the force of res judicata;
- User uses a version of the Component which is not the current version, or
- infringement results from the failure of User to strictly comply with the Documentation and the provisions of the Agreement.

In the event of any such claim from a third-party against User and/or GATLING CORP, or threat of action or if GATLING CORP deems it likely to happen, GATLING CORP may, at its sole discretion, and subject to the conditions referred to above try to attempt to obtain the right for User to continue to use the disputed part of the Component, or replace the Component.

It is specified that the warranty stated in this section is restrictive. GATLING CORP expressly disclaims any express or implied warranty, which is not expressly defined in the Agreement.

User warrants that it owns the necessary intellectual property rights and/or rights of use required by their respective owners, relating to any elements made available to GATLING CORP in the performance of the Agreement, in particular its web applications or any Data, and that the conclusion and the performance of the Agreement shall not infringe any agreement concluded by User with a third party or any third-party’s rights. Failing that, User shall bear all the consequences and liabilities thereof and guarantee GATLING CORP against all claims, upon request.


### 8. DATA

User is the owner of the Data and in particular the test results obtained by using the Component.


### 9. FEEDBACK & REVIEWS

User may provide Feedback to GATLING CORP regarding the Component. Feedback is voluntary and is not Confidential Information, even if designated as such. GATLING CORP may fully exercise and exploit such Feedback for the purpose of (i) improving the operation, functionality and use of GATLING CORP’s existing and future product offerings and commercializing such offerings; and (ii) publishing aggregated statistics about the quality of the Component, provided that no data in any such publication will be used to specifically identify User.

User hereby grants GATLING CORP a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any such Feedback, in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement limits GATLING CORP’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

The User may also post reviews regarding the Component. When publishing reviews, User shall comply with following:

- The terms of this Agreement;
- Not make any false or misleading review;
- Ensure that the review is honest and in good-faith;
- Disclose any affiliation with a publisher or any conflict of interest (e.g. if you are a competitor).

GATLING CORP does not claim ownership of the content of reviews or comments you post on the Component. However, you agree that this content is licensed to us just like “Feedback” and that we can use and publish this content and incorporate it into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed, and permit others to do so.

### 16. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Except where a breach of the defaulting Party makes the contractual relation impossible to maintain, the Parties will try to reach an out-of-court settlement for any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, the enforcement or the termination of the Agreement. In the event that the Parties cannot reach an amicable solution within fifteen (15) Business Days as from the delivery of the corresponding notice by a Party to the other Party, the Parties irrevocably agree that the Courts of Paris shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with the Agreement or its subject matter, notwithstanding the plurality of defendants, claim against guarantor, summary or conservatory proceeding.
