Logging in is necessary to use Gatling Enterprise. Gatling Enterprise is accessible by default on port 10542.

If it is the first time you use Gatling Enterprise, you can use the super admin account with the following credentials:

- Login: *superAdmin*
- Password: generated by the configuration step or in the `frontline.conf` file. You can change it in the frontline.conf file.

If you have configured OpenID authentication, all your users can connect as viewers. Make sure that Gatling Enterprise is allowed to open pop-ups on your browser, or you won't be able to log in.
To connect as a superAdmin, click on *Connect with basic credentials* and fill in the form as previously explained. To modify your users' permissions, go to the [users admin page]({{< ref "../admin/users" >}}), and modify the users.
