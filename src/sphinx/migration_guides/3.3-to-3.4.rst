.. _3.3-to-3.4:

#########################
Migrating from 3.3 to 3.4
#########################

.. note::
    Gatling 3.4 is not binary compatible with previous versions.
    Any code compiled with a previous version must be recompiled in order to be executed with Gatling 3.4.
    Changes listed below are only about source compatibility changes.

* Core:

  * the Session based versions of ``transform`` and ``transformOption`` were renamed into ``transformWithSession`` and ``transformOptionWithSession``.
  * ``xpath`` check's namespaces are now a ``Map[String, String]`` instead of a ``List[(String, String)]``

* HTTP:

  * ``hostNameAliases`` now takes a ``Map[String, List[String]]`` instead of a ``Map[String, String]``
